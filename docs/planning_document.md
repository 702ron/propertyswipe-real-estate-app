### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)
- **Database:** Supabase or PlanetScale
- **CDN:** Cloudflare for image optimization
- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking
- **Analytics:** Posthog for user behavior tracking

## Data Architecture

### Core Entities
1. **Users** - Demographics, preferences, contact info
2. **Properties** - MLS data, images, features, availability
3. **Interactions** - Swipes, views, time spent, preferences
4. **Agents** - Contact info, assigned properties, performance metrics
5. **Leads** - Generated matches, contact attempts, conversion status

### External Integrations
- **MLS Data Provider** (Spark API, Trestle, or similar)
- **CRM Integration** (HubSpot, Salesforce, or Chime)
- **Email Service** (SendGrid or AWS SES)
- **SMS Service** (Twilio)
- **Maps/Location** (Google Maps API)

## User Experience Flow

- **MLS Compliance** - Ensure all MLS usage follows provider guidelines
- **Lead Quality** - Implement fraud detection and validation

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### User Engagement
- **DAU/MAU Ratio** - Target 30%+ for engaged user base
- **Session Duration** - Average 8-12 minutes per session
- **Properties per Session** - 15-25 properties viewed
- **Return Rate** - 60%+ return within 7 days

### Lead Generation
- **Swipe-to-Lead Rate** - 3-5% of right swipes convert to leads
- **Lead Quality Score** - Based on engagement depth and follow-through
- **Agent Response Time** - Target <2 hours for initial contact
- **Showing Conversion** - 25%+ of leads schedule property viewings

### Business Impact
- **Cost per Lead** - Target 50-70% lower than traditional methods
- **Agent Satisfaction** - 4.5+ star rating from agent partners
- **Revenue per User** - Track commission attribution from app-generated leads

## Development Methodology
